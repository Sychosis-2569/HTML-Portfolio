<h1>The Best Movies According to Gerrit:</h1>

<h2>My favourite 3 movies ever.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Snatch</h3>
<p>I love the comedy in Guy Ritchie films.</p>

<h3>Pressure</h3>
<p>Coming from a Commercial Diver Background, I love basically any commercial diving movies that can help me explain some of the things I talk about.</p>

<h3>Lone Survivor</h3>
<p>It simply is an amazing testament to the training and resilience of men and women serving in the armed and special forces.</p>
